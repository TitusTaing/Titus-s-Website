**Porsche 918 Spyder**

I started to like this car when I was in 3rd grade. It is a hybrid with exhaust caps above the bumper and I thought the acid green accents were really cool.
I also started to like Porsche as well. The V8 engine produces 608 horsepower and 390 lb-ft of torque. There are dual electric motors: front and rear, which added 279 horsepower, pushing total output to 887 horsepower and a stunning 944 lb-ft of torque. I really liked hybrid cars when I first started getting into cars. I was really interested in electric and new fuel technologies that could be used in the future. At the time, I was really biased and only really liked fast or expensive cars. However, as my car taste has grown, I have started to appreciate all cars and still keep track of new and exciting developments in the car world.
